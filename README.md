Assessing the fit between data and results of a system dynamics simulational model is part of a larger set of confidence buidling tests (Sterman, 2000). Specifically, in the behavior reproduction test, one is seeking to replicate observed behavior in the real system. In system dynamics, observed behavior usually means the reference mode or some longitudinal pattern that is the focus of a system dynamics study, but observed behavior can also include patterns of association such as a correlation or covariance matrix, a distribution, phase space, and really any other way that behavior may be observed.
